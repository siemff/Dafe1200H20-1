  <h1>Salary</h1>
  <h2 id="coders">Coders' salary</h2>
  <p>Sometimes, difference in pay is down to skills (and the demand for them). <a href="https://www.itjobswatch.co.uk/IT-Job-Market/UK/Programming-Languages">For example coding languages.</a> </p>

<p>This data is presumably based on job-adverts, and the data is collected in the first six months of 2020. Which was a roller-coaster period for many IT-businesses.</p>

<h3 id="skills">Salaries are not just about the main skills</h3>
<p>Usually, secondary skills are wanted as well. And experience counts a lot.</p>
<p>Therefore, please mind that "median salary" is not <em>first-job pay</em> (not starting positions). So with a lot of experienced Java-programmers out there, the median salary may be much higher than starting salary.</p>

<p>Concerning secondary skills, look at "Go". A new langugage, compared to Java, with a tenth of the "Historical permanent job-ads" of Java. It is better paid in general, which should leed us to assume that it may have a much higher starting salary. That would not be odd. Go is used for scalebility in networked servers. If you know Go, you probably now a bit about scaleable network servers as well.</p>

<h3 id="gender">The difficulty of comparing salaries</h3>
<p>The difficulty in comparing salaries, is easiest illustrated by looking at men versus women.</p>
 <p>Men <strong>consistently</strong> earn more than women in general. However, whenever we attempt to brake it down and ensure that we compare similar jobs with comperable tasks, the difference <em>almost</em> disappears. This was illustrated yet again, in a recent discussion about pay in academia.</p>

  Her ser vi eit interessant mønster: mennene tener i gjennomsnitt nesten 65 tusen meir enn kvinnene, trass i at kvinner tener meir enn menn i tre av dei fire stillingskodane. Det er kun for førsteamanuensar at mennene tener mest. Ein kan også legge merke til at lønnsforskjellane for kvar stillingskode er små (mellom to og åtte tusen) samanlikna med den aggregerte forskjellen på 65 tusen. Den store forskjellen mellom menns og kvinners lønn kjem altså av at dei har ulik jobb. Den vanlegaste stillinga for mennene i utvalget er professor, medan den vanlegaste stillinga for kvinnene er stipendiat.

<h1 id="know">Glass doors, ceilings, and salary</h1>
 <p>If we continue to look at women and pay, does this mean that we just have to wait and the pay-gap will sort it self out? Preliminiary data from the IT-business is not just promissing. A <a href="https://research.hackerrank.com/women-in-tech/2019#intro" title="Women in tech">recent report (from HackerRank)</a> highlight how women consistently work in more junior positions than men at the same age.</p>

  <h2>The importance of information</h2>
  <p>In Norway, you may ask for the exact salary and pay (with overtime) for anyone publicly employed. You want to know my salary? Ask OsloMet. Webpages like those mentioned above, as well as labour unions, try to collect salary data so you can find out how your pay compares to others'.</p>
  <p>Yet, as we know from studies on women and advancement, about recruitment and people without networks — either from out-of-town, or worse, foreign — who you know may be more important.</p>
  <p>That is why unions, and webpages like <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com">Glassdoor.com</a> are important. They will help you see if you recieve a fair pay. And they may share information about how fair the overall culture is in a company. (Glassdoor.com does, unions may not.)</p>
