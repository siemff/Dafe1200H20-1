<h1>Tags format the text</h1>
<p>Tags are used to format the text. Like the "Heading 1" and "Paragraph" that I have used here.</p>
<p>There are many basic tags and several more specialised tags. Browsers will give a default formating for these tags. Additionally, the web developer may define how some or all these formating tags should be displayed. Also, the user may specify a custom theme (stylesheet) to be used, and this will override both default settings and those set by the designer.</p>

<h2>Basic tags</h2>
  <p>Headings -- written h1, h2, ... h6 -- should be familiar from any word processing software. Similarly, paragraphs (p). Only important part: <strong>Remember to exit (close) any tag!</strong> That is the forward-slash tag, as in /p.</p>
  <p>Not <em>all</em> tags will have a closing tag, for example <code>&lt;br&gt;</code><br />, which inserts a linebreak. Then, we usually end it with a forward slash in the end.</p>

<p>There are several more formating tags. For example <em>emphasis/ italics</em> and <strong>strong/ bold/ fat</strong> text.</p>

<p>The most important principle, is <strong><em>consistency</em></strong>. You must use tags consistently and ensure, for example, that you never follow a H1 with a H3 without a H2 inbetween. More on that later.</p>

<h1>Tags defines text and layout</h1>
    <p>Then there are tags to make text clearly separate from the rest. For example we use <code>&lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; when we need a wrapper for code/ script/ tags that should not be executed but displayed as code</code> on the webpage.</p>

<p>We have tags for ordered and unordered lists (&lt;ol&gt; and &lt;ul&gt;).</p>
<p>I use Atom instead of IntelliJ because:</p>
<ol type="a"> <!-- 'type="a"' is an _attribute_ to the tag -->
  <li>I didn't get hold of a license key before summer and</li>
  <li>I don't know how to make the text BIG in IntelliJ</li>
</ol>
